    He fought Roxas. And I can only surmise

    Riku lost that fight.

  drk: >-
    Riku must have realized thdrk:

    to fight in the realm of darkness,{:delay E4 00}{:clear }he would have to immerse himself

    That's why Xemnas brought him

    into the Organization--{:delay 96 00}{:clear }{:delay 30 00}But Roxas betrayed them. {:delay 5A 00}{:clear }{:delay 36 00}After that I fought him because I thought
