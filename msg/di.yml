    The one who was with Riku

    and me all the time--{:delay 97 00}{:clear }we played together on that island.{:delay 89 00}{:clear } {:delay 4B 00}{:clear }His voice always used to be there...

    but now it´s gone.{:delay 13 01}{:clear }I can´t think of his face, or his name.{:delay A2 00}{:clear } {:delay 32 00}{:clear }I feel awful about it.{:delay 64 00}{:clear } {:delay 28 00}{:clear }So I told myself--{:delay 6E 00}{:clear } {:delay 22 00}{:clear }I´m not going to the island until

    we made a promise, something important.{:delay 77 01}{:clear } {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }This letter is where it starts. I know it.
