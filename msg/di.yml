    Hey, do you feel like going out to the

    island?{:delay AA 00}{:clear } {:delay 32 00}{:clear }Tidus and Wakka are all wrapped up in

    their ball game and they won´t go with me.
- id: 16796
  drk: Not today, sorry.
- id: 16797
  drk: Aw, why not?
- id: 16798
  drk: >-
    Do you remember those boys

    who used to hang out with us?
- id: 16799
  drk: Riku?
- id: 16800
  drk: Yeah.
- id: 16801
  drk: >-
    I wonder whatever happened to him.

    I sure miss him.
- id: 16802
  drk: >-
    He´s far away.

    But I know we´ll see him again.
- id: 16803
  drk: Sure. Of course we will.
- id: 16804
  drk: And the other boy?
- id: 16805
  drk: What other boy?
- id: 16806
  drk: >-
    The one who was with Riku

    and me all the time--{:delay 97 00}{:clear }we played together on that island.{:delay 89 00}{:clear } {:delay 4B 00}{:clear }His voice always used to be there...

    but now it´s gone.{:delay 13 01}{:clear }I can´t think of his face, or his name.{:delay A2 00}{:clear } {:delay 32 00}{:clear }I feel awful about it.{:delay 64 00}{:clear } {:delay 28 00}{:clear }So I told myself--{:delay 6E 00}{:clear } {:delay 22 00}{:clear }I´m not going to the island until

    I remember everything about him.

    A letter... I wrote it yesterday,{:delay C6 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }to the boy I can´t remember.{:delay 6B 00}{:clear } {:delay 0A 00}{:clear }I said that no matter where he is...

    I´ll find him. One day.{:delay F5 00}{:clear } {:delay 28 00}{:clear }And when I stopped writing, I remembered

    we made a promise, something important.{:delay 77 01}{:clear } {:delay 0F 00}{:clear }This letter is where it starts. I know it.
- id: 16813
  drk: Wow... I hope he gets it.

  drk: He will.
- id: 16815
  drk: Starts with an "S."

- id: 16818
  drk: Maybe...waiting isn´t good enough.
- id: 16819
  drk: My thoughts exactly!{:delay 64 00}{:clear }If you have a dream, don´t wait. Act.{:delay BA 00}{:clear }One of life´s little rules. Got it memorized?
- id: 16820
  drk: Who are you?
- id: 16821
  drk: Axel.{:delay 5A 00}{:clear }I happen to be an acquaintance of Sora´s.
- id: 16822
  drk: Why don´t we go see him?
- id: 16823
  drk: '...Sora?'
- id: 16824
  drk: We´ve got something in common, Kairi.{:delay AF 00}{:clear }You and I both miss someone we care about.{:delay ED 00}{:clear }Hey...I feel like we´re friends already.
