  drk: You see a painting of a lion.
- id: 15245
  drk: >-
    You see, whoever saves the The Darkness Lands

    will be our next king...{:delay F6 00}{:clear }and he has to have the right qualities.
- id: 17174
  drk: >-
    Scar told us that Mufasa died

    in a wildebeest stampede.{:clear }I can´t believe it was actually Scar

    who killed him. He has to pay!
- id: 17175
  drk: >-
    Scar ran toward the king´s den!{:clear }Scar´s despicable, but he´s strong.

    Be careful.
- id: 17176
  drk: >-
    The hyenas also benefitted

    from Mufasa being gone.{:clear }That´s probably why they teamed up

    with Scar.
- id: 17177
  drk: >-
    Scar tries to confuse his opponents

    by jumping in and out.{:clear }Plan your tactics accordingly when

    fighting him.
- id: 17178
  drk: >-
    If you´re looking for Simba, he

    probably went to the {:theme 0A}oasis{:reset}.{:clear }It´s quiet there, and the perfect place

    for thinking.
- id: 17179
  drk: >-
    Nala, Timon and the others all went to

    the king´s den!{:clear }The hyenas ran after them, too. We´ve

    got to help Timon and the others!
- id: 17180
  drk: >-
    Scar sure is bad!{:clear }So, we really need to be ready

    to help out against the hyenas.
- id: 17181
  drk: >-
    Simba... You have to beat Scar...

    Please save our kingdom...
- id: 17182
  drk: >-
    If Scar´s alone, I´m sure Simba can handle

    it, but who knows what he has planned?{:clear }Please, Sora. Go make sure Simba´s all

    right.
- id: 17183
  drk: >-
    Simba chased after Scar toward

    the {:theme 0A}peak up above{:reset}.{:clear }This is the grand finale.

    Go cheer Simba on!
- id: 17184
  drk: >-
    That lioness looked

    pretty serious.{:clear }Save the kingdom, defeat the king...

    what kind of world have we come to?
- id: 17185
  drk: >-
    To get to Pride Rock, we should head

    toward that large mountain, right?{:clear }We´d better get going. Nala´s waiting

    for us.
- id: 17186
  drk: >-
    I wonder what that scream was.

    It came from the {:theme 0A}jungle{:reset}.
- id: 17187
  drk: >-
    It sounds like Simba´s friends

    are in trouble!{:clear }This may be a new enemy.

    Let´s go after {:theme 0A}Simba{:reset}!
- id: 17189
  drk: >-
    Simba has something that Mufasa

    didn´t. He must figure this out himself.{:clear }I´ll be waiting for you, Simba.
- id: 17190
  drk: >-
    All my old "friends" left me just

    because of how I smell.{:clear }But now I have Timon, and I'm livin' a

    life of hakuna matata!
- id: 17191
  drk: >-
    Simba thought the world

    of his father.{:clear }That´s why he compares himself with

    Mufasa, and feels so unsure.
- id: 17192
  drk: >-
    He seemed troubled by a lot of things

    when we lived at the oasis.{:clear }He´s gotten so huge, but the most

    important part of him never grew up.
- id: 17193
  drk: >-
    {:theme 0A}Rafiki{:reset} is really wise.

    He might know what we should do.{:clear }If you´re ever in a bind, you should

    see what he has to say.
- id: 17252
  drk: >-
    Simba and Nala used to play together

    when they were younger.{:clear }They were really close, those two.

    Tee hee!
- id: 17253
  drk: >-
    I evacuated the others!{:clear }Please, you have to win. For Simba

    and our child!
- id: 17254
  drk: >-
    It looks like something´s riding on top

    of that monster!{:clear }It couldn´t be controlling it,

    could it?
- id: 17255
  drk: >-
    What are we gonna do if that beast

    comes here?{:clear }You´ve gotta stop it in the {:theme 0A}savannah{:reset},

    or this place´ll be destroyed!
- id: 17256
  drk: >-
    You must really be bored to be

    wandering about these parts.{:clear }Has Scar´s ghost vanished already?
- id: 17257
  drk: >-
    Heh heh. It´s lookin´ like the

    kingdom´s falling apart.{:clear }Don´t worry, if that happens, we´ll

    become your new king.
- id: 17258
  drk: >-
    Eh heh heh heh heh...

    (He sounds happy.)
- id: 17259
  drk: >-
    Scar used to bring us food all the

    time.{:clear }He must have thought us easy to

    manipulate.
- id: 17260
  drk: >-
    It´s back to scavenging

    again.{:clear }So long as we´re still alive, though, I

    guess we can´t complain.
- id: 17261
  drk: >-
    Eee hee hee hee! Gyah hah hah hah.

    (He seems downright ecstatic.)
- id: 17717
  drk: >-
    It´s hard to be king...{:clear }Mufasa and Simba have both

    dealt with the challenges.
- id: 17718
  drk: >-
    Timon told me they like

    eating bugs.{:clear }He said Simba ate them, too. He´s

    courageous in more ways than one!
- id: 17719
  drk: >-
    I wonder if Simba´s cub will go

    through trials like him.{:clear }Even if it does, I´m sure in the end

    it will live up to the family heritage.
- id: 17720
  drk: >-
    My, don´t you look delicious today!

    Ah ha ha... I´m just kidding, of course.{:clear }You helped Simba save the The Darkness Lands.

    Thank you!
- id: 18072
  drk: >-
    If Kairi saw you like this, I bet she´d

    think you were cute!{:clear }I guess those magical clothes of

    yours transformed you.
- id: 18073
  drk: >-
    We´re gonna have to learn how to defend

    ourselves, bein´ on all fours like this.{:clear }I bet there are lots of moves

    we can do that we normally couldn´t!
- id: 18746
  drk: >-
    Defeat Scar!

    Watch his movements and

    attack when the time is right!
- id: 18747

    Defeat the Giant Darkness!

    A jump attack from behind may take him down!

    The king´s den is in there, where a

    He may be living in the king´s den,
